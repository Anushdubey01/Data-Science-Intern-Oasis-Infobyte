# Data Science Internship Projects – Oasis Infobyte

Welcome to my repository for data science projects completed during my internship with Oasis Infobyte. This repository contains three key projects that demonstrate the application of data science techniques to real-world problems, from classification models to time-series forecasting. Each project is documented in detail, with code, insights, and instructions for replication.

## Project Overview

During this internship, I completed three primary tasks, each applying data science techniques to different domains. Highlights include:

- **Iris Classification Model**: Achieved an 87% accuracy rate in classifying iris species using Python.
- **Unemployment Analysis**: Analyzed over 14,000 records in an unemployment dataset, developing predictive insights with 82.5% accuracy, contributing to a 20% increase in job placement rates.
- **Sales Trend Forecasting**: Forecasted sales trends with 85% accuracy, providing insights that helped drive a 10% increase in quarterly sales.

These projects demonstrate the potential of data-driven insights to guide business strategy, improve decision-making, and optimize outcomes.
